      <h2>Interest and Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my interests is soccer. I've been playing soccer since
        I could walk. I played club ball up until high school where I became a starter
        in only my sophmore year and in my senior year i was given the honor of Team
        Captain. During my senior year I damaged some ligaments in my
        right knee that prevents me from playing much anymore. I tried to switch to
        coaching but it just wasn't for me, though I do not play much or coach
        anymore I do still watch it regularly, mainly European fixtures, I can't
        stand watching American soccer.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another hobby I have is reading. My favoite author at the
        moment is Christopher Paolini, the author of the Inheritance Series (Eragon,
        Eldest, Brisingr, Inheritance). I have read every book in that series
        numerous times. Other series and authors I read often are The Oregon Files
         by Clive Cussler, Percy Jackson and the Olympians/ Heroes of Olympus
        by Rick Riordan, and The Presidential Agent by WEB Griffen. I'm also a
        history buff and love to read and learn about the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also been known to enjoy gaming. I do most of my
        gaming on console (PS4), I play on console for many reasons, the main one
        being that my current laptop can't handle high detail graphics and building
        a new gaming PC is expensive. I play wide variety of games ranging from
        FPS's to RPG's. though I'm not very good at most video game I still play
        them and find them entertaining.
