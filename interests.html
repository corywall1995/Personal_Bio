      <h2>Interest and Hobbies:</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my interests is soccer; I've been playing soccer
        for as long as I can remember. I played club ball up until high school
        where I tried out for and made the varsity team as a freshman and became
        a starter my sophmore year. In my senior year I was given the honor
        of Team Captain also during my senior year I damaged some ligaments in my
        right knee that prevents me from playing much anymore. I tried to switch
        to coaching but it just wasn't for me. Though I do not play much or coach
        anymore I do still watch it regularly. My favorite club is Manchester
        United FC (an English club), and if I had to choose a second favorite it
        would be FC Bayern Munich (a German club).
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another hobby I have is reading. My favoite author at the
        moment is Christopher Paolini, the author of the Inheritance Series (Eragon,
        Eldest, Brisingr, Inheritance). I have read every book in that series
        numerous times. Other series and authors I read often are The Oregon Files
        by Clive Cussler, Percy Jackson and the Olympians/ Heroes of Olympus
        by Rick Riordan, and The Presidential Agent by WEB Griffen. I'm also a
        history buff and love to read and learn about the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also been known to enjoy gaming. I do most of my
        gaming on console (PS4), I play on console for many reasons, the main one
        being that my current laptop can't handle most modern games and building
        a gaming PC is expensive. I play wide variety of games ranging from
        FPS's to RPG's. I'm not very good at most video games, but I still play
        them and find them entertaining.
