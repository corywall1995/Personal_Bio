    <h1>My Interests</h1>
    <p>
      I have many interests and hobbies, too many to include them all but I will
      include the main ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my interests is soccer. I've been playing soccer essentially since
      I could walk. I played club ball up until high school where I became a starter
      in only my sophmore year and then was given the honor of team captain my
      senior year. During my senior year I damaged some ligaments in my
      right knee that prevent me from playing much anymore. I tried to switch to
      coaching but it just wasn't for me, though I do not play much or coach
      anymore I do still watch it regularlly, mainly European fixtures, I can't
      stand watching American soccer.
