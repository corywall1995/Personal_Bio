      <h2>My Coding Experience</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This course, CINS 110, is the first coding class I've
        taken at CSU, Chico. It is not, however, the first coding class I've taken.
        My first coding class was in my sophmore year of high school (2010) when
        I took a photoshop/ web design course. My next coding class came my junior
        year of high school when I took a computer game programming class. At Butte
        College I took Programming and Algorithms 1 (CSCI 111), Programming and
        Algorithms 2 (CSCI 211), and Computer Design and Architecture (EECE 237).
        In these classes I used a variety of programming languages such as C++,
        HLA, and HTML.

      <p>
        The reason I'm taking this Wed Development course is that 1) It is requried
        for my major, and 2) I took a web design class in high school and ever
        since then web development and coding has been an interest of mine.
